# ASSOCIATION-RULE-LEARNING-2

# Business Problem
- We want to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning using a dataset containing service users and 
 the services and categories that these users have received.

# Data Story

- The data set consists of the services received by customers and the categories of these services.
- It contains the date and time information of each service received.

- UserId: Customer number
- ServiceId: Anonymized services belonging to each category (Example: Sofa washing service under the cleaning category)
A ServiceId can be found under different categories and refers to different services under different categories. (Example: CategoryId 7 ServiceId 4 refers to honeycomb cleaning while CategoryId 2 ServiceId 4 refers to furniture assembly)
- CategoryId: Anonymized categories (Example: Cleaning, transportation, renovation category)
- CreateDate: Date the service was purchased
